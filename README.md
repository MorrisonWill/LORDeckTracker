# LORDeckTracker

A simple deck tracker for the online card game Legends of Runeterra. For those who don't know, a deck tracker keeps track of the cards you have played throughout a match, and presents you with the odds of drawing certain cards on your next turn. This information allows you to make better choices and hopefully win more often. In this project, I used the local Legends of Runeterra API and presented the data using a framework based on the famous C++ Dear Imgui library: https://github.com/AllenDang/giu.
